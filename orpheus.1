Everything you need to do is to run the following command:

.B    orpheus -r next

    add <files..>
        Adds specified files to the current play list. Please note the
        command itself and file names must be the same parameters, e.g.

.I            $ orpheus -r "add /home/konst/mp3/song1.mpg"

        Several files can be specified using this command as well:
